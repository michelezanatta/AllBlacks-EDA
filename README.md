# AllBlacks-EDA
This is an Exploratory Data Analysis on the All Blacks Dataset I have found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harryarthur/all-black-match-data20032018). The main objectives of this work is to gain some insights about the results All blacks have obtained during the period considered, using some of the classical EDA tools. 

This is a work of my own. I choose the dataset, how to work and how much time to dedicate on it. This report is not intended to be formal or shown during a presentation, but it is a fun way to dive into the EDA.

After uploading the library I used to get the job done, I have imported the dataset and applied basic preprocessing methodologies to getting to know the dataset. Then I have proceeded to work on the EDA, and at the very end I applied a t-test to see, in a very simplistic way, if the EDA was correct.

For any correction, suggestion and/or question please do not hesitate to contact me.
